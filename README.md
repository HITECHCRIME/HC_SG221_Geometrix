## Lyrics

```
HC_SG221
got loose chains up 
make it count to all the vertices
sacred geometries are nothing more than this
but they're bound to be meant
as a sign of the fake 
all the fakeness we tend to keep at bay
stray pulling points might into crash 
ever present dopamine rushing fervent stash

```
